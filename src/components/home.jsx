     Over the years I have accumulated a large number years of leadership and management experience first in the movie theatre industry and more recently in grocery stores. I learned to recognize strengths of various team members to get goals accomplished. 
<br></br>
      Another lesson learned as I was amassing experience over the 25 years in service industries is I wanted to switch and get into a field not so simple for everyone to jump into.  I was informed of an opportunity to begin learning bout technology. I was able to enroll in to a full stack bootcamp ran by Digital Crafts at the City of Refuge location in Atlanta.
